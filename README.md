## Cloudrail in a Nutshell
### Discover, Detect, and Control

Your cloud infrastructure is built, managed, and deployed using automation. Your security framework should discover potentially new infrastructure, detect security issues, and allow you to control what gets deployed.

### Policy-as-Code

Your policy requirements should not be stuck in spreadsheets. Empower your team with continuous security attestation.
### Cloud Security the DevOps Way

Fixing cloud security after deployment is time consuming and requires a lot of effort. Detect cloud security issues early in the development process. Treat security violations as simple code fixes.
